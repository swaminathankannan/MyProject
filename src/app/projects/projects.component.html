                        Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the
                        seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow
                        quickly, mature early, and are short-lived.

                        Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven
                        gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.

                    <p>
                        Dolphins are widespread. Most species prefer the warm waters of the tropic zones, but some, such
                        as the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but
                        a few, such as the orca, feed on large mammals such as seals.
